# Stock-Data-Analysis-Python-Project
This project showcases my skills in extracting and visualizing stock data using Python. Leveraging the yfinance library and web scraping with BeautifulSoup, I obtained historical stock information for Tesla and GameStop. The extracted data was then plotted alongside revenue data, creating insightful graphs using plotly. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in data extraction and manipulation but also highlights my ability to present meaningful insights through visualizations. Explore the Jupyter Notebook to see the code and visualizations that offer a comprehensive view of historical stock performances for Tesla and GameStop up to June 2021.
